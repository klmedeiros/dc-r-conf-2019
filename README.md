## Metric design and dashboarding with tidymetrics & shinybones

Slides + code from my 2019 DC R conference talk, Metric design and dashboarding with tidymetrics & shinybones. Watch a recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BL5NBRxnl3E&list=PLlzRFZmxVl9Q5cgX9-DtLmnA_YVRwkTgr&index=26&t=0s) on the Lander Analytics YouTube.

**FOR THE CODE in the .Rmds TO WORK, you must go download the [Stack Overflow R Question datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/rquestions) from Kaggle!!**

You'll need all of the following packages:
